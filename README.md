# IoT-Air-Quality-Monitor-esp32
ESP32-based IoT air quality monitoring system includes a real-time alert mechanism that instantly notifies users when environmental conditions become unsafe. The system continuously collects data from MQ135 (CO₂), MQ7 (CO), DHT22/11, and the GP2Y1010 PM2.5 dust sensor, and transmits this data to a cloud dashboard for live monitoring.
